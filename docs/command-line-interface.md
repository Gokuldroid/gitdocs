# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The GitDocs CLI is used to initial, build, serve, and deploy your documentation

## Initialization

This command initializes a new project with everything you need to get started.

<Tip>We recommend starting a project like this if you've never used GitDocs before.</Tip>

The build command builds your documentation for release. The command takes two (2) optional positional arguments.

| Argument | Optional? | Default | Use |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | --- |
| output | Yes | `'docs-dist'` | Specifies the output directory for the build. |
| doc-version | Yes | '' | If specified, overrides the `'version'` property in the config. |

`gitdocs serve [path]`

The serve command lets you preview your documentation locally. The command takes a single optional positional argument. If this argument is not specified, the `react-static` dev server is used to display the documentation. This 

| Argument | Optional? | Default | Use |
