# Automatic Table of contents

## Table of Contents

## Usage

GitDocs will automatically generate a table of contents for you based on the structure of our document's headers. To include it you simple need to include it as it's own header like so:

```
## Table of Contents
```

## Notes

You can use any level of header or place your table of contents wherever you like.
