# GitDocs

Easy to use, SEO-friendly, beautiful documentation that lives in your git repo.

## How does it work

`gitdocs` is distributed as a package on npm. It is a cli that you can simply install with `npm install gitdocs -g`. You can run `gitdocs serve` to preview your docs or `gitdocs build` to generate a static site wherever you like.

## Installation

Using npm:

```bash
npm i -g gitdocs
npm start
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add gitdocs
```

## Quick Start

Assuming you have a folder with markdown files at `/docs`, you can automatically preview your docs site by running.

```bash
gitdocs serve
```

- The `readme.md` in your repo will be used as the default homepage for your docs
- `docs.json` allows you to specify your project settings like the version, name and much more
- The navigation will automatically be built using your docs folder structure, but you can override this in `docs.json` to generate your own navigation. See [configuration/sidebar](/configuration/sidebar.md) for more info.
